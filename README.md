##Description##
This application consists of two programs.

1) **FindRing.py**:
     - finds a contractile ring in a z-stack time series. This generates a csv file containing positions and the size of the ring at each time point.

2) **divPlaneClass.py** (requires the csv file generated by FindRing.py): 
     - to validate ring position and size this program generates reconstructed division planes and draws contractile rings detected by FindRing;
     - quantifies the fluorescence intensities along the contractile ring perimeter within arcs of a specified angular range;
     - generates a kymograph of the division plane from the central z plane;
     - calculates cortical fluorescence from the central plane;

##Setup##
* Install python with all dependencies: opencv, scipy, numpy, pillow, matplotlib, pyqt4, lmfit
* FindRing.py parameters (change at the bottom of the file):
  -`series = '01'` prefix in the file name, i.e. *series*Ring.tif (input images)
  -`timePointStart = 1` slide number to start ring detection. Make sure that intensity in the equatorial band is higher than at the surrounding cortex
  -`flip = False` Check that anterior side is at the top, otherwise change to True
  -`folder = ''` folder name with the images
  -`filename = folder+series+'Ring.tif'` file name of the images with embryo z stacks
  -`nSlices = 30` number of z slices in a stack
  -`zPixelScale = 4.` number of pixels in the camera per 1um (ie 1um = 250nm x 4 pixels)
  -`tol = 8` number of pixels allowed for ring position misalignment
  -`chromosomeMarker = False` if chromosome marker is present, the algorithm will try to detect and remove them before processing
  -`lateStage=False` if the ring is half way closed or more at the first slide, change to True
  -`kernelSize = 5` the size of the gaussian filter before processing (has to be odd)
  -`embryoCenterDrift = 'linear'` defines how the center of the embryo in z is calculated;
   -'independent': calculate center for each timepoint independently (use when the depth is manually adjusted through out imaging);
   -'linear': the center depth is calculated from a linear fit to detected individual centers (use when a steady drift is observed, like imaging on agarose pads);
   -'median': calculates median position for the center (use only when there is no drift of the embryo center)
     
* divPlaneClass parameters (change at the bottom of the file):
  -`fileName = '01Ring.csv'` full path to the input file
  -`dts = 30` time between time points
  -`nZ = 30` number of Z planes
  -`dZ = 4.` pixels between z
  -`pixelSize = 0.25` pixel size in microns
  -`da = 20.` averaging angle in degrees (angle step size)
  -`drS = 0.1` averaging distance inside the ring
  -`drL = 0.3` averaging distance outside the ring
